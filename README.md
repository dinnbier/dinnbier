Hi!
I'm Adrián, I'm a computer science engineer with a solid experience as Math teacher and passionate about design, motion graphics and beatifully explained concepts.

I design dynamic, interactive applications, motion graphics and assessments for e-learning platforms using the open source program GeoGebra, P5, 
Manim and other technologies.

The combination of geometry, programming and creativity creates an ideal environment to learn. 
Interactive applications are an extremely valuable tool that provides an easy environment to teach, explain and make things to understand. 
Most of the new software is being successful because there is a community supporting and enriching it. 
I would like to contribute to that community and I encourage math, science and computer teachers to do so.

I love climbing, I love english, I like design and technology. I love visual explanations of complicated ideas. 
After years of studying Math, programming and languages I know how hard understanding new concepts could be and 
how valuable is to find someone who teaches with passion. 
I'm always trying to find that passion. Sometimes I succeed.
